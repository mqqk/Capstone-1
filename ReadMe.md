# **FBI API with Crime Stats from States and Jurisdictions** #

## Summary ##

This application is designed to allow the user easier access to aggregated statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) public application program interface (API). While the FBI statistics appear accurate and mostly complete, they rely on consistent and accurate reporting from individual agencies. For this reason, some queries may not produce the desired results.

The landing page details the goals of the application, provides some key terms that might be useful, and advises which search tool are currently available.

Currently, there are two search queries available:

-State Arrest by Year for aggregate crimes
-Jurisdiction by Year for summarized crimes reported/solved

The format, at this time, is optimized for two queries simultaneously in each category. The goal is to give the search tool more versatility and present the data in a more compact, easy to digest format.

The data requests populate into separate columns. Unfortunately, the FBI's response is often times unsorted, but at least appears complete. The application does ** NOT ** at this time sort or organize, but the ultimate plan is to provides this functionality.
